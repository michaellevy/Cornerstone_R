The course is designed for quantitatively-oriented professionals but assumes no prior programming knowledge. By the end of the workshop, participants will understand the motivation for computational workflows including automation, collaboration, flexibility, and reproducability and be able to implement them. Participants will be able to efficiently clean data, organize it for analysis, estimate and work with the output of statistical models, produce a variety of publication-quality plots, and compose dynamic documents that integrate writing, code, and code output. \n\n## Topics & Tentative Schedule\n\n#### Day 1 AM\n\n- Spreadsheets and fundamentals of tabular data\n- Data cleaning with OpenRefine\n- Motivation for R and orientation to RStudio\n- R foundations (base R)\n\n#### Day 1 PM\n\n- Visualization (ggplot2)\n- Data i/o\n\n#### Day 2 AM\n\n- Data manipulation (dplyr)\n- Tidy data (tidyr)\n- Working with multiple tables (dplyr)\n- Statistical modeling\n\n#### Day 2 PM \n\n- Writing functions\n- Dynamic documents (knitr)\n- Capstone exercise\n\n\n## Resources\n\nThere are three webpages participants will want to keep open in a browser during the workshop:\n\n1. [**Live Script**](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/984522cetf3ejyb/LiveScript.R) -- The instructors will code live during the workshop, and you will learn more efficiently by coding along. Should you fall behind, have a typo, or have trouble reading the code, this webpage provides a real-time link to the code the instructors are writing. Simply refresh the webpage (typically cmd/ctrl-r or F5) and you can copy and paste code into RStudio. Additionally, there will be exercises that ask you to build on code the instructors have written, and this ensures that you have that code in working form. This file will remain available after the workshop as a reference.\n\n1. [**Etherpad**](https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/CSR_R_Workshop) -- A place for instructors to quickly make available URLs, notes, and links, and for students to ask questions and add info that would be helpful for others. This will persist throughout the workshop.\n\n1. [**Multiple choice question responses**](https://goo.gl/forms/9oxNlcxHRKg6GkNG3) -- Periodically, you will be asked to reason about some code or write code to solve a specific problem. These questions serve as a bridge to the more open-ended exercises, and they help the instructors adjust the pace of the workshop based on participants' understanding.\n\n## Participation\n\nCoding is a participatory sport. The more you do it, the faster you will learn. To that end, lectures will frequently be interrupted with exercises to implement what you just learned. These exercises will grow more complex and challenging over the two days and will culminate in the capstone exercise at the end of day 2, which mimics a full (small) data analysis project. Likewise, the instructors will be writing code, live during the class. This demonstrates the process of solving computational problems rather than simply seeing the final product. You can expect the instructors to make mistakes and to learn how they diagnose and de-bug code in the process. \n\nLearning a programming language is like learning a human language. It takes time and repeated practice, and the first steps are the hardest. It gets easier and more fun with time. Expect to finish each day feeling cognitively fatigued with a strong sense of accomplishment. \n\n#### Stickies\n\nYou will have two sticky notes during the workshop, one red and one green. These serve multiple purposes. If you ever get stuck and need instructor help, place the red sticky on your laptop. This way you can get help without interrupting the class. During in-class exercises, use the red sticky similarly to ask for help, and place the green sticky on your laptop to signal that you are done with the exercise and ready to move on.\n\n#### Feedback\n\nYou will frequently be asked for feedback on the pace and structure of the course. This is always anonymous. The more candid you are, the better the class will be.",
